### Hi There ðŸ‘‹

I would like to tell you briefly about myself. I am constantly try to improve my ability to think polymorphicaly and to find solutions to problems from different angles. I believe that my profession is a philosophical and artistic profession as well as a mathematical and technical. That's why I try to improve myself in the fields of ethics and creativity as much as I try to improve myself in mathematical and technical fields.
